Funds vanishing into properties that don’t exist, names of “donors” who had been dead for decades, and entire columns of figures that seemed to shift when she looked away. Now, with her once-stable career unraveling, Betty finds herself drawn into Arkham’s shadowed streets, where the Lodge’s corruption festers like a hidden rot. She knows the numbers don’t lie, rather the opposite, for in Arkham the truth they reveal may be far worse than fraud.",
