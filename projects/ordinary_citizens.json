Sure, she can help give out some medicines or whatnot, but her constant nightmares of what she saw haunt her tremendously. Worse yet, she believes that whatever caused those horrific tragedies is coming for her next, around every corner and in every shadow. \"Just gotta help a few more fellas, and that'll be enough dough to skip town for good\", she keeps telling herself.",
