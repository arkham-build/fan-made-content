If you hadn't seen him alive and well earlier tonight, you'd swear he'd been dead for weeks. \nYour line of thought is interrupted as the ballroom's curtains suddenly ignite, and the room erupts into flame. Panicked, you shield your eyes and stagger away from the old man's body. You push through a pair of ornate double doors, ready to resume your escape---and find yourself in back in the Tratorria del Parche's dining hall.\nWith dismay, you realize that all you've accomplished after your terrified flight through the hotel is a single loop through the estate.\nThere is a groan behind you. You take a glance backward into the fiery ballroom, only to see the old man's corpse rise achingly to its feet, like something out of a nightmare. The wordless hiss it makes when it notices you watching is all the encouragement you need to resume running.</i></blockquote>\nDiscard all enemies from play that are not currently engaged with an investigator.\nMove each investigator to Trattoria del Parche and return the remaining set-aside location connected to Trattoria del Parche to play, unrevealed (Bar L'Ammaliatrice or Trattoria Kitchens). Remove each revealed location other than Trattoria del Parche from the game, placing any locations with Victory X that have been cleared of clues in the victory display. Refill clues on Trattoria del Parche to its maximum clue value.\nSpawn the set-aside Declan O'Doyle enemy at Trattoria del Parche, exhausted. Then, shuffle the set-aside <i>Inferno</i> encounter set into the encounter deck, along with the encounter discard pile. Advance to Act 3a.",

One pale and sweating man reclines on a chaise lounge, pressing a damp cloth to a deep cut on his brow; another frantically relays information to the police over the telephone. Several lifeless bodies lie around the parlor. The wounded man opens one bloodshot eye as you make your entrance. \"We've got company, Dashiell.\" You explain that you've been searching for the Tenebrarum Lodge, and the reclining man laughs bitterly. \"Congratulations,\" he says, his voice laced with irony. \"You've found our secret lair. Make yourself at home.\" The two men introduce themselves as Erle Gardner and Dashiell Hammett, two aspiring writers and members of the Tenebrarum Lodge. Once Hammett is off the phone, he gives you the lowdown: the Tenebrarum killer has struck again, just moments before your arrival. \"The bastard's name is Pietro Spadarotto, an art dealer who joined the Lodge a few months back. He broke in, made a real spectacle of stealing a book, then opened fire.\" You wonder aloud what book could be worth killing for. \"It’s by one of our founding members: 'Megapolisomancy' by Thibaut de Castries. Some occult drivel about using geometry or buildings to do magic. Pure fiction.\" Hammett shrugs, his voice tinged with disdain. \"We’ve got a few copies lying around. Take one if you like. Hell, maybe it’ll even make sense to you.\"</i></blockquote>\nChoose an investigator to take control of the set aside Megapolisomancy story asset. <hr><b>Additionally, each investigator that was \"<i>invited to join the Tenebrarum Lodge</i>\" may read the following text: </b>\n<blockquote><i>You mention the invitation you received to join the Lodge, and Hammett’s expression twists into something you can’t quite pin down. \"Miss Mercer doesn’t send out invitations on a whim, only to those she knows are meant for success,\" he says. \"What did you do to impress her?\" When you admit you don’t know, a slow, knowing smile curls on his lips. \"I suppose it doesn’t matter,\" he murmurs. \"If Mercer says you're in, then she must have something special in store for you.\"</i></blockquote>\nYou gain 2 experience.

By tapping into the bizarre art of megapolisomancy, the art dealer has been slipping into the very fabric of the city through the fog---a trick he never imagined anyone would turn against him. When you finally find him, he’s on his hands and knees in the muck, sniveling like a dog in front of a tall, stately woman. \"Miss Mercer,\" he sobs, his voice thick with desperation. \"Haven’t I made you proud? Isn't it enough, yet? Why aren't you happy?\"  Spadarotto’s tears are met with nothing but cold indifference. The fog curls around them, but it’s clear who holds the power here. Miss Mercer lifts her gaze from the pathetic sight before her to acknowledge you with a cold, mocking stare. \"You big oaf,\" she laughs, her voice a deadly mix of sugar and ice. \"All that power sure did make you stupid. You didn’t even bother to check if someone was tailing you.\" She turns, the sound of her heels echoing against the pavement as she walks away. \"Clean up your mess.\"\nSpadarotto whirls around, and you can see it in his eyes---he’s lost it completely. With a terrified shriek, he bolts in the opposite direction, driven by pure, mindless panic.</i></blockquote>\nMove each investigator to the nearest [[San Francisco]] location and remove the following locations from the game, if applicable: Tenebrarum Lodge, Ah Toy's Pleasure Parlor, The House of Shields, and Madame Moustache's.\nThe lead investigator must decide (choose one):<hr><b>- We've got to stop the killer!</b>\nFor each Fog Token on Corona Heights, place a new Fog Token on a location in play, prioritizing locations without Fog Tokens if possible.
