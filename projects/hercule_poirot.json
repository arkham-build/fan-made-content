From his early days in the Brussels police to his life as a private detective in London, Poirot made a name for himself due to his patient observation and fastidious logic. Despite his skill and fame, Poirot only took on the cases that interested him personally. As the roaring twenties entered full swing, news of the mysterious town of Arkham finally reached his desk. These were not mere superstitions from the ignorant masses, but carefully catalogued impossibilities corroborated by Miskatonic scholars. Curious and confident in equal measure, Poirot departs for Arkham alongside his longtime friend Captain Hastings.",
